High Level Programming coursework, team 4.

## Running the code

### Expecto tests

Enter the `team/editor/src/Emulator/Tests` directory and run with `dotnet run`.

If you are using windows, you can also run the tests with `run-expecto-tests.bat` from the repo's root directory.

### GUI

**Windows instructions:**  
Unzip `team\editor\dist\Blue-win32-x64.zip` to a directory of your choice and run `Blue.exe`.  
Alternatively, execute `setup.bat`. It will create a new directory `Blue` and launch the Blue GUI.  
The GUI can then be started anytime by running `Blue\Blue.exe`.  

Prerequisites:
- Tar if using `setup.bat` (Packaged w/ Windows 10 from build 17063)  
or  
- Any method of extracting a zip file if following the manual extraction (7zip/WinRAR/Tar...)


**Alternative method:**  
Enter the `team/editor` directory and follow the instructions in the [README](team/editor/README.md/#Getting-Started) 
(like Visual2). The app can be compiled and run live or packed to then be used on Windows/Linux/macOS.

Prerequisites:
- Yarn
- Node
- Dotnet Core SDK (latest version)
